# A FPGA on a IIsi PDS card...

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to be able to interface a modern (2023 era) [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) with a [Macintosh IIsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_IIsi) using its PDS (Processor Direct Slot) connector. The PDS is basically just a physical connector to the MC68030 memory bus.

So unless you're a retrocomputing enthusiast with such a machine, this is useless. If you are such an enthusiast, then maybe the ability to connect a modern LCD monitor using a digital interface to an old Macintosh might be of interest to you.

This project was 'spun off' the [NuBusFPGA](https://github.com/rdolbeau/NuBusFPGA), a similar project for the NuBus used in several models of Macintosh of the era. NuBusFPGA itself is a spin-off of the [SBusFPGA](https://github.com/rdolbeau/SBusFPGA), a similar project for the SBus used in Sun's SPARCstation.

## Current status

Some preliminary work done, nothing working yet.
